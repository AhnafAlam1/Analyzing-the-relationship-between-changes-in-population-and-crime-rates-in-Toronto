Make this sound more professional but do not change the idea of the paraghraph: Policing is a hot topic across all cities in Canada, and with the recent population boom behest of immigration, people have become skeptical of the federal government's policy of bringing more people into the country. While immigration tends to decrease the crime rate [@lee2009immigration], the public, nonetheless, tends to attribute immigration as the reason behind increasing crime. Increased immigration, however, has contributed to higher population density across all Toronto neighbourhoods. This has prompted people to demand extra police presence in areas of higher criminal activity, even though previous studies have shown that somewhat limiting proactive policing can reduce crime [@sullivan2017evidence]. Public officials have responded to the demands of Torontonians by increasing the policing budget for the upcoming 2024 year [@Lautenschlager_2023]; whether this increase in budget will be effective or not will depend on how this additional money is used. Moreover, there is a growing call on public officials to allocate more policing resources to areas of the city where population density tends to be higher, as the number of criminal activity tends to be higher in such areas. In this paper, I look to see whether this claim that crime rates tend to be higher in areas of increased population density is valid or not, as this could have policy implications in terms of policing decisions.

Studies have shown that criminal activities tend to increase due to socio-economic disadvantages [@glaeser1999there]. However, it is less clear whether these criminal activities are related to the population density of neighbourhoods where people find themselves. In this paper, I look at this relationship and find that while it is true that criminal activity, namely shootings, assault, auto thefts, and robberies, do tend to be higher in areas where the population is more significant, crime rate, however, which looks at crimes committed per 100,000 people, tells us that crime is constant across Toronto neighbourhoods, regardless of population density. This has policy implications as if police were to reallocate additional resources to areas where crime numbers are higher, the effect on the community may be less favourable. Having too many police in the community can create tension and distrust [@rouse1985relationship] between those who live in the community and the authorities. Furthermore, a disproportionate increase in police presence in certain areas, achieved by reallocating policing resources from other regions, may increase crime within the latter areas.

Going forward, I will expand on the data set and explain why only some variables were used under the Data section. The following Discussion and Limitation section will include the graphs and a detailed analysis of those graphs. Finally, I will conclude the paper by providing a summary of my analysis and will delve into potential changes for future iterations of this paper.

Law enforcement is a prominent and widely debated issue across urban centers in Canada, particularly given the recent surge in population attributed to immigration. Despite studies indicating that immigration tends to lower crime rates [@lee2009immigration], public perception often associates an uptick in criminal activities with the influx of newcomers. The escalation in immigration has led to heightened population density in various neighborhoods across Toronto, prompting calls for increased police presence in areas identified as having elevated criminal activity. Notwithstanding, prior research suggests that a more restrained approach to proactive policing can result in crime reduction [@sullivan2017evidence].

Responding to the concerns voiced by Toronto residents, public officials have approved an augmented policing budget for the upcoming fiscal year [@Lautenschlager_2023]. The effectiveness of this budgetary increase hinges on the strategic allocation of the additional resources. Furthermore, there is a mounting demand for public officials to allocate policing resources in accordance with the population density, as crime tends to be more prevalent in densely populated areas. This study aims to scrutinize the validity of the claim that crime rates are inherently higher in regions with increased population density, exploring potential policy implications for policing decisions.

Research indicates that criminal activities are often influenced by socio-economic disparities [@glaeser1999there]. However, the correlation between these criminal activities and the population density of neighborhoods remains less clear. This paper seeks to elucidate this relationship, revealing that while certain criminal activities such as shootings, assault, auto thefts, and robberies are more prevalent in areas with higher population density, the crime rate, measured as crimes committed per 100,000 people, remains consistent across Toronto neighborhoods, regardless of population density. This finding holds significant policy implications, as reallocating resources based solely on higher crime numbers may yield unfavorable community outcomes. An excessive police presence can foster tension and distrust within communities [@rouse1985relationship]. Additionally, a disproportionate increase in police deployment achieved by reallocating resources may inadvertently elevate crime rates in the areas that experience a reduction in policing resources.

In the subsequent sections, this paper will elaborate on the dataset, providing rationale for the inclusion of specific variables in the Data section. The ensuing Discussion and Limitation section will feature graphical representations accompanied by a meticulous analysis. Finally, the paper will conclude by summarizing the analysis and proposing potential modifications for subsequent iterations.


Me:
Please do the same for these two paragraph: This is a policy-relevant finding; if Toronto Police were to allocate more resources to locations where the crime count seems high, this may create a sense of distrust in the community [@rouse1985relationship], which is the opposite of the authorities' objectives. Alternatively, suppose police decide to reallocate resources from neighbourhoods with lower crime numbers to communities with high crime figures. In that case, this may result in a spike in crime in less-densely populated places due to a lack of authority in the area.

Me: 
The primary limitation of this discussion derives from the fact that the incorporated data does not include any policing information. Due to the lack of policing data, this paper assumes that policing budget and resources are shared equally amongst all the neighbourhoods. There may be variations in how police resources are utilized in different neighbourhoods. The only definitive way to assert how policing resources are allocated is by incorporating police data. In the future iteration of this paper, researchers should incorporate policing data that allows us to control for differences in policing measures across neighbourhoods.


ChatGPT: 
This finding holds significant policy implications for the Toronto Police, as an ill-considered allocation of resources based solely on apparent crime counts may inadvertently erode community trust, contrary to the objectives of law enforcement [@rouse1985relationship]. If the police opt to redistribute resources from areas with lower reported crime to those with higher figures, the potential consequence may be an increase in criminal activity in less densely populated regions, stemming from a diminished law enforcement presence in those areas. Striking a balance between addressing areas with high crime counts and maintaining a consistent law enforcement presence in less-densely populated communities is essential for achieving effective and community-oriented policing.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge a primary limitation in this discussion, stemming from the absence of policing information in the incorporated dataset. The paper assumes an equitable distribution of policing budget and resources across all neighborhoods due to the lack of specific policing data. In reality, variations may exist in the utilization of police resources in different neighborhoods. To enhance the robustness of future iterations, researchers should incorporate comprehensive policing data, allowing for the control of differences in policing measures across diverse neighborhoods. This will provide a more accurate understanding of resource allocation and aid in formulating nuanced policy recommendations for law enforcement strategies.

Apply the same to these two paragraph: A similar data set could have been utilized in this paper, consisting of the neighbourhoods with their corresponding aggregate crime count and crime rates, without the separation of types of crime. However, this approach was not taken as the statistic would not be a fair reflection of the number and rates of crime. As previously stated, some crimes are under-reported. Therefore, the statistical value for crimes may be a discounted figure of the actual numbers. 

Furthermore, the summary table omits crime data from previous years as the dataset does not come with population statistics from those years, making it redundant for our analysis purposes. The cleaning portion of the data is concluded by renaming all the variables to have better readability. After the adjustment, "Pop2023" refers to the population of each neighbourhood in 2023. "Assualt" stands for a count of assault crimes for the year 2023, and "A_Rate" refers to the assault rate for the year 2023, and this renaming method applies to all the remaining crime-related variables. It should be noted that Table 1 only consists of observations for only five random neighbourhoods instead of all 158. This was done purposefully as @tbl-one is intended to give a snapshot into what the data looks like after cleaning, and including information on all 158 would have been unnecessary. 


ChatGPT: 
An alternative approach for this paper could have involved utilizing a comparable dataset, comprising neighborhoods with aggregate crime counts and crime rates, without the disaggregation of crime types. However, this methodology was not adopted due to its potential lack of fairness in reflecting the true extent of crime numbers and rates. As previously highlighted, certain crimes are prone to under-reporting, introducing a risk of the statistical values being underestimated compared to the actual occurrences.

Additionally, the summary table intentionally excludes crime data from prior years due to the absence of corresponding population statistics for those years, rendering such data redundant for the purposes of our analysis. The data cleaning process is finalized through the renaming of variables to enhance readability. Following these adjustments, "Pop2023" denotes the population of each neighborhood in 2023, "Assault" signifies the count of assault crimes in the year 2023, and "A_Rate" represents the assault rate for the same year. This renaming convention extends to all other crime-related variables. It is important to note that Table 1 comprises observations for only five randomly selected neighborhoods out of the total 158. This deliberate choice for @tbl-one is aimed at offering a snapshot of the data post-cleaning, with the inclusion of information on all 158 neighborhoods deemed unnecessary for the intended purpose.

rewrite this better: Both figures contain least squares line. It represents a line that is the best fit for a set of dependent and independent values [@stat]. For the purposes of this paper, the independent variable is always 2023 population statistics and independent variables varies between different crimes and their respective rates. The line is essentially there to highlight trends that might exist in data, that may not be easily noticeable

ChatGPT:
Both graphs feature a least squares line, which serves as the optimal fit for a given set of dependent and independent values [@stat]. In the context of this paper, the independent variable consistently pertains to 2023 population statistics, while the dependent variables differ across various crimes and their respective rates. The primary purpose of the line is to accentuate potential trends within the data that might not be readily apparent.

Me: 
rewrite this more concisely: Analyzing the data, we observe that @fig-uno contains graphs featuring a neighborhood with an outlier. In statistics, outliers are observations that deviate significantly from other values in the dataset [@outliers]. Focusing on the graph for auto theft, we clearly see a neighborhood with a population close to 40,000 people and auto thefts well exceeding 400 car thefts, reaching a figure closer to 800 thefts. This is noteworthy because every other neighborhood experienced fewer than 300 car thefts in 2023. Outliers typically highlight breaks in trends that may not be obvious at first glance.

There may be systematic policing differences in the outlier neighborhood, or perhaps there are neighborhood-related issues that make it easier to steal cars. In the latter case, we could dismiss the outlier if there are no obvious differences in neighborhoods, and that particular area simply has a high auto theft rate. Eliminating that neighborhood could provide us with a clearer visual and understanding of how the majority of Toronto neighborhoods look in terms of car thefts. However, we lack sufficient information to dismiss the outlier neighborhood from our research.

The next iteration of this paper will delve deeper into these obscure neighborhoods to gain an understanding of why some crimes are exceptionally high in certain areas. Additionally, it is important to note that the graphs, in their current form, do not indicate whether the outlier neighborhood in the auto thefts graph is an outlier for all other remaining crimes, and whether there is an underlying feature about this neighborhood that makes it easier to commit crime. This is something the future iteration of the paper should examine.

ChatGPT:

Analyzing @fig-uno, we find a graph featuring a neighborhood outlier—a statistical observation significantly deviating from others [@outliers]. Specifically, the auto theft graph highlights a neighborhood with close to 40,000 people experiencing auto thefts surpassing 400, reaching nearly 800, while every other neighborhood had fewer than 300 car thefts in 2023. This outlier may indicate policing differences or neighborhood-specific issues facilitating car theft.

Eliminating the outlier could enhance our understanding of typical car theft patterns in Toronto neighborhoods. However, lacking sufficient information, we refrain from dismissing it in this research. The next iteration will further investigate these obscure neighborhoods to understand why certain areas exhibit exceptionally high crime rates. Importantly, the current graphs don't reveal whether the auto theft outlier neighborhood is atypical for all other crimes or if there's an underlying factor making it prone to crime—a consideration for future iterations.
